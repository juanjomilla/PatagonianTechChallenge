# Patagonian - Backend Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the Patagonian Backend challenge! The solution implemented consists on 3 projects: one for the database script and two versions of the API (netcore and node.js). 

Each directory contains its own README file which explains what the directory contains and how to run it. 

Additionally, for the APIs there is an html file named `api.html` which contains the API specification. 

## Prerequisites

First of all, you need to populate the database. After the database is populated, you can run any of the APIs.

Follow the steps in the [script README file](./script/README.md) to know how to populate it.
## APIs
Below you can find the routes to the corresponding README file. At this point, you should be able to use them. Follow the steps mentioned on each README to know how to run the API:
- netcore [readme file](./netcore/README.md)
- nodejs [readme file](./nodejs/README.md)
