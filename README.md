# PatagonianTech - API Challenge

## Overview

You will find 3 folders. Each of them contains its own README file to explain what the directory contains and how to run it. Along with these 3 folders, you will find the API spefication for both projects. The API specification is the html file `api.html`.

## How to use them

First of all, you need to populate the database. After the database is populated, you can run any of the APIs.
So, you must start with `script` directory first. Follow the steps in the README file to know how to populate the database for each project.

- script [readme file](./script/README.md)
- netcore [readme file](./netcore/README.md)
- nodejs [readme file](./nodejs/README.md)
